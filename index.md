<h1>HI, I'M KAIDEN MASTEL</h1>
<h2>ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
<p>Hi, I am kaiden, and I am currently a Software Engineering student at the University of Alberta. I have been programming since I was fourteen years old, and have experience in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, MATLAB, as well as experience using Unreal Engine 4 and Godot Engine. I am highly passionate about mathematics and programming, and am currently looking for challenges to take my skills to the next level.</p>

<h2>MY PROJECTS</h2>
<h3>CIRCLING CIRCLES</h3>
<p>For my first semester of my software engineering program, I elected to participate in an optional programming contest, which required making a game using Matlab. I decided to make a game where:</p>
<p>
1. The Players goal is to move forward as long as possible, with a background that scrolls with the player.<br>
2. The Player has a constant speed, with a button press moving the player in the direction of their "pointer".<br>
3. Infinitely generating obstacles that cause game over when touched.<br>
</p>
<h4>Demonstration</h4>

<h3>PLUNDERPIECE</h3>
<p>PlunderPiece is the game I am currently in the process of designing and programming. This is a game where:</p>
<p>
1. The Players goal is to collect all the coins on a chess board using the minimum amount of moves.<br>
2. The Player may place the chess peices given to them anywhere on the board that is not occupied by a wall or another peice.<br>
3. All Peices must be placed before moves may be made.<br>
4. Chess peices move the same as they do in regular chess, and any coin in "The line of Movement" of the chess peice is collected.
</p>
<p>Some features will be addded for user convienience and to increase or decrease difficulty.</p>
